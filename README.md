# Deep Learning and Computer Vision for Game Developers

The goal: A complete production ready scientific computing and deep learning library in minimal dependencies C that still allows for elegant expression of tensor math, deep learning, and computer vision.

Ideally with optional hardware acceleration that's implemented in a portable simple way

From this codebase you should be able to implement, train, run, and play with:
- transformers (including with MOE)
- convnets
- perceptrons
- GRUs
- PSlam
- Dtam
- AlphaZero
